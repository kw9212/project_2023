This project is to collaborate on several files to achieve the final goal of "find specific e-mails through keywords and notify them through messengers such as slack." I left comments about mainly functions on each project file (.py). And in this file, I'm going to write about the plan, the bugs, and the problems that happened during the testing process here.
