This project aims to collaborate on several files to achieve the final goal of 
"finding specific emails through keywords and notifying them through messengers such as Slack." 

I have included comments mainly about the functions in each project file (.py). 
In this file, I will document the plan, bugs, and problems that occurred during the testing process.
