This project aims to collaborate on several files to achieve the final goal of 
"finding specific emails through keywords and notifying them through messengers such as Slack." 

I have included comments mainly about the functions in each project file (.py). 
In this file, I will document the plan, bugs, and problems that occurred during the testing process.

After several tests, the program was successful in sending an email to the target email address using Python code, with a Gmail address as the sender. Next, we will work on implementing the ability to send emails with attached files.
