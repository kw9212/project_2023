## Overview
This idea came from the challenge of having to sort through many emails every day to find the important ones. Gmail already has a labeling function that classifies emails based on specific email addresses as filters. This project aims to create a function that sends notifications based on keywords using slack and smartphones. There is also potential to expand this project to find information in other ways besides just keywords.
